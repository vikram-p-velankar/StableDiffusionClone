# Generative Models for Image Synthesis
Advanced Data Mining Project (CIS 5700) — Winter 2025 (Dr. Srijita Das)

This repository contains a comprehensive exploration and implementation of generative models for image synthesis, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, along with their evaluation using widely-accepted metrics.

## 📘 Overview
The project is centered around building and evaluating generative models that learn to produce high-quality images. The key components of this project include:

GANs: Implementations of standard and advanced GAN architectures.

Diffusion Models: Step-wise generative modeling using noise scheduling and denoising techniques.

Evaluation: Use of metrics such as Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to quantify the performance of generated images.

## 📂 Contents
Adv_Data_Mining_Proj.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing:

Implementation of GANs and Diffusion models.

Training processes on image datasets.

Edit
torch
torchvision
numpy
matplotlib
tqdm
scipy
Pillow
scikit-learn

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
We used the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the generative models:

Inception Score (IS): Measures the quality and diversity of generated images.

Fréchet Inception Distance (FID): Compares the distribution of generated images with real images.

## 📊 Results
Generated outputs were visually assessed and quantitatively evaluated using IS and FID. Key findings and comparisons between GANs and Diffusion models are included in the notebook.
